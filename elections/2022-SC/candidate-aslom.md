I joined Knative in 2019 to focus on making Knative Eventing more serverless by enabling auto-scaling support for the Apache Kafka event source in Go and Java using KEDA. I participated in working groups, proposed auto-scaling annotations used by the Kafka source, showed results of running scalability tests, opened issues, fixed bugs, answering questions in Slack etc.

I am running because I think that Knative needs more contributors and I would like to help Knative increase its maturity level so it can reach the CNCF graduation stage. I think that currently we do not have enough contributors - in particular, it seem that making contributions today is time consuming and many potential contributors give up. I reached that conclusion watching questions and problems raised in the Knative Slack channels and recently when I took part in Kubecon NA 2022 Knative ContribFest. As part of steering committee, I would work to make Knative a great serverless experience for contributors and end users. Hopefully, that leads to increasing the number of project adopters, which is critical for reaching the CNCF graduation stage for Knative.
